q1: Not finished, so no need to check the code and files.


My idea is to search labelled butterfly dataset for object tracking to train a multiple object tracking model, e.g. mmtracking, deepsort,... I find an object detection training set of butterflies images, but unfortunately I need time more for debugging and find the proper setup for the conda environment. 




q2: finished


My idea is to visualize the sound wave first to see what is the pattern of a syllable (Pa/Ta/Ka). Then I tried to capture each large fluctuations in the sound wave and considered it as one syllable.
